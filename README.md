Parenthesis Validator
====
This program contains logic which validates that a string contains properly 
nested parenthesis. For example, the string "()" is properly nested because
the open parenthesis "(" is balanced by a close parenthesis ")" and 
the string "(()" is not properly nested because there is an unbalanced open 
parenthesis "(". This program contains logic to validate a string with up to three different
types of braces -- "(" and ")", "\[" and "\]", "{" and "}".
